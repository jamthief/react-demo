**A tiny example React application**

React is a javascript library for building user interfaces. [Find it here.](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

This is a one-page example of how to build and link components together using React, Babel and Webpack.

## Installation

Clone the repository, then step inside. Then

```
npm install
npm install --global grunt-cli
```

## Usage

For viewing the example,

```
grunt serve
```

then visit localhost:8000 in a browser.

For development,

```
NODE_ENV=production grunt build
```

will build the React application (bundle.js) and then start a watch process to wait for changes.
